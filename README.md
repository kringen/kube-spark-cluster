# Spark Cluster on Kubernetes
This repo contains the files necessary to deploy a [Spark cluster](https://spark.apache.org/) on a basic [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.  This deployment will create 1 master node and any number of worker nodes.  Each node runs as a kubernetes pod.  This should work regardless of the kubernetes deployment.  It should work with any cloud provider or bare metal.

## Installation
### Deployment Values
Deployment variables should be updated in the [values.yaml](charts/spark-cluster/values.yaml) file.

Master and worker nodes use the same image version by default.  In addition, 1 master node is deployed by default.  This is configured in the *master* section:
```bash
master:
  name: spark-master
  replicas: 1
  container:
    name: spark-base
    imageRepository: kringen
    image: spark-base
    imageVersion: 3.8.0
```
The number of worker nodes is configured in the *worker* section.  The number of replicas controls how many worker nodes are created.
```bash
worker:
  name: spark-worker
  replicas: 5
  container:
    name: spark-base
    imageRepository: kringen
    image: spark-base
    imageVersion: 3.8.0
```
### Deployment Command
The Spark cluster is deployed using the following command from the *kube-spark-cluster/charts* folder:
```bash
helm install spark-cluster ./spark-cluster
```
